# Lab 02: Working with Lists

Fill a list with 10 random numbers from the interval [-100, 100]
and permutate its elements so that all positive numbers are placed
at the start of the list and all negative numbers and zero are placed
at the end.\
For example, given a list:\
`[20, -90, 15, -34, 10, 0]`\
The result should be:\
`[20, 15, 10, -90, -34, 0]`
